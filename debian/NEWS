apt (0.7.23) unstable; urgency=low

  * Code that determines which proxy to use was changed. Now
    'Acquire::{http,ftp}::Proxy[::<host>]' options have the highest priority,
    and '{http,ftp}_proxy' environment variables are used only if options
    mentioned above are not specified.

apt (0.6.44) unstable; urgency=low

  * apt-ftparchive --db now uses Berkeley DB_BTREE instead of DB_HASH. 
    If you use a database created by an older version of apt, delete 
    it and allow it to be recreated the next time.

apt (0.5.25) unstable; urgency=low

  * apt-ftparchive --db now uses Berkeley DB version 4.2.  If used with a
    database created by an older version of apt, an attempt will be made
    to upgrade the database, but this may not work in all cases.  If your
    database is not automatically upgraded, delete it and allow it to be
    recreated the next time.
