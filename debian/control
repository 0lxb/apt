Description: Debian's advanced package tool
 APT provides mechanisms for package management tasks like searching,
 querying and managing deb packages from one or more package
 repoistories.
 .
 It supports:
 * searching for package information;
 * resolving package install requests, finding the appropriate
   version in the archives;
 * fetching packages along with all their required dependencies;
 * authenticating the sources and validating the retrieved data;
 * installing and removing packages on a working system.
 .
 It also provides various terminal-based tools on its own:
 * apt-get for managing packages and retrieval of information
 * apt-cache for querying available information
 * apt-cdrom to use removable media as a source for packages
 * apt-config as an interface to the configuration settings
 * apt-key as an interface to manage authentication keys
 .
 APT is also highly configurable and can be extended to support
 additional protocols.
