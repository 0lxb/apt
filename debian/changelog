apt (0.5.22) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated French translation of man pages from Philippe Batailler
    <philippe.batailler@free.fr> (Closes: #203119)
  * Initialize StatusFile in debSystem (Closes: #229791)
  * Fix apt-get's suggests/recommends printing, which was skipping every
    other dependency due to both using GlobOr and incrementing the DepIterator
    (Closes: #229722)

apt (0.5.21) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patch from Eric Wong <normalperson@yhbt.net> to include apt18n.h after
    other headers to avoid breaking locale.h when setlocale() is defined
    as an empty macro.  This was not a problem on Debian, but broke
    compilation on Solaris. (Closes: #226509)
  * Updated French translation from Pierre Machard <pmachard@debian.org>
    (Closes: #226886)
  * Add colons to apt-get's "kept back"/"upgraded"/"downgraded" messages

  * Clearer error message in place of "...has no available version, but
    exists in the database" (Closes: #212203)
  * Patch from Oliver Kurth <oku@masqmail.cx> to use AC_CACHE_VAL for
    GLIBC_VER to make cross-compilation easier (Closes: #221528)
  * Add example preferences file (Closes: #220799)
  * Updated Greek translation from Konstantinos Margaritis <markos@debian.org>

    <debian@cgarbs.de> (Closes: #197960)
  * Add an "apt-cache madison" command with an output format similar to
    the katie tool of the same name (but less functionality)
  * Fix debSourcesIndex::Describe() to correctly say "Sources" rather than
    "Packages"

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Sat,  3 Jan 2004 23:42:50 -0800

    the checksum entries

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Fri,  2 Jan 2004 11:24:35 -0800

apt (0.5.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Enable apt-ftparchive to generate Release files.  Hopefully this will
    make it easier for folks to secure their apt-able packages

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Fri, 26 Dec 2003 12:53:21 -0800

apt (0.5.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * po/de.po update from Michael Karcher <karcher@physik.fu-berlin.de>
    (Closes: #222560)
  * Update config.guess and config.sub from autotools-dev 20031007.1
  * Add knetbsd to buildlib/ostable (Closes: #212344)
  * Don't suggest apt-get -f install to correct broken build-deps; broken
    installed packages are rarely the cause (Closes: #220858)
  * Avoid clobbering configure.in if sed fails

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Wed, 24 Dec 2003 14:54:40 -0800

apt (0.5.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Spanish man pages, patch from Ruben Porras <nahoo82@telefonica.net>
    (Closes: #195444)
    - apt.es.8 wasn't included in the patch, but was referenced.  Fetched
      version 1.3 from debian-doc cvs
    - Create doc/es/.cvsignore
  * Patch from Koblinger Egmont <egmont@uhulinux.hu> to fix
    pkgCache::PkgFileIterator::Label() to correctly refer to File->Label
    rather than File->Origin (Closes: #213311)
  * Add missing comma and space to German translation of "downgraded"
    (Closes: #213975)
  * Add missing comma in apt_preferences(5) (Closes: #215362)
  * Fix whitespace in French translation of "Yes, do as I say!", which
    made it tricky to type.  Thanks to Sylvain Pasche
    <sylvain.pasche@switzerland.org> (Closes: #217152)
  * Let apt-get build-dep try alternatives if the installed package
    doesn't meet version requirements (Closes: #214736)
  * Fix version display for recommends (Closes: #219900)
  * Use isatty rather than ttyname for checking if stdin is a terminal.
    isatty has the advantage of not requiring /proc under Linux, and thus
    Closes: #221728
  * Correctly implement -n as a synonym for --names-only (Closes: #224515)
  * Update apt-cache(8)
    - Document --installed
    - --recursive applies to both depends and rdepends
  * Japanese translation of documentation from Kurasawa Nozomu <nabetaro@slug.jp>
    (Closes: #186235)
  * Clarify documentation of --no-upgrade in apt-get(8) (Closes: #219743)
  * Clean up and simplify some of the suggests/recommends display in apt-get
  * Use cvs update -d in debian/rules cvs-build rather than just update
  * Pass --preserve-envvar PATH --preserve-envvar CCACHE_DIR to debuild.  apt
    takes a long time to build, and ccache helps

apt (0.5.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * apt-get build-dep, when trying to skip over the remaining elements of
    an or-expression, would accidentally inherit the version requirements of a
    later item in the or-expression.  Fixed it.
  * Let apt-get build-dep try alternatives if the first dependency in an
    or-expression is not available
  * Add a Debug::BuildDeps to generate some trace output
  * Help apt-get build-dep produce more useful error messages
  * Process build-dependencies in forward rather than reverse order
  * Error out if an installed package is too new for a << or <=
    build-dependency
  * apt-get build-dep should now be able to handle almost any package with
    correct build-depends.  The primary exception is build-dependencies on
    virtual packages with more than one provider, and these are
    discouraged for automated processing (but still common,
    unfortunately).

apt (0.5.13) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Document configuration file comment syntax in apt.conf(5)
    (Closes: #211262)
  * s/removed/installed/ in a comment in apt-get.cc
  * Move comment for ListParser::ParseDepends into the right place
  * Don't preserve ownership when copying config.guess and config.sub.
    This broke builds where the clean target was run with different
    privileges than the rest of the build (i.e., root) (Closes: #212183)
  * On second thought, don't copy config.guess and config.sub at all.  I'd
    rather they always match what is in CVS.

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Mon, 22 Sep 2003 10:28:17 -0400

apt (0.5.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Exclude subdirectories named 'debian-installer' from the apt-cdrom
    search (Closes: #210485 -- release-critical)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Thu, 11 Sep 2003 21:48:14 -0400

apt (0.5.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated pt_BR translations from Andre Luis Lopes <andrelop@debian.org>
    (Closes: #208302)
  * In apt.conf(5), give the fully qualified name of Dir::Bin::Methods,
    rather than just "methods"
  * Add new nb and nn translations from Petter Reinholdtsen <pere@hungry.com>
  * Clean up reportbug script a bit, and extend it to distinguish between a
    configuration file not existing and the user declining to submit it with
    the report
  * Add #include <langinfo.h> to cmdline/apt-get.cc.  This apparently gets
    pulled in by something else with recent g++ and/or glibc, but is
    required when building on, e.g., stable
  * Patch from Koblinger Egmont <egmont@uhulinux.hu> to fix version
    comparisons with '~' (Closes: #205960)
  * Disable Russian translation until someone can review it
    (Closes: #207690)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Wed, 10 Sep 2003 19:41:28 -0400

apt (0.5.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Correct the section in apt_preferences(5) on interpreting priorities
    to show that zero is not a valid priority, and print a warning if such
    a pin is encountered in the preferences file (Closes: #204971)
  * Regenerate French man pages from sgml source (Closes: #205886)
  * Get self-tests compiling again, updated for latest library API
    and g++ 3.3
  * Add version comparison tests for #194327 and #205960
  * Fix error message in version test to output versions in the order in
    which they were compared when the reverse comparison fails
  * Reference the source package bug page rather than the one for the
    binary package 'apt' in the man pages (Closes: #205290)
  * Updated Polish po file from Marcin Owsiany <porridge@debian.org>
    (Closes: #205950)
  * Mention some of the available frontends in apt-get(8) (Closes: #205829)
  * Add apt-config to SEE ALSO section of apt-get (Closes: #205036)
  * Add missing "lang" attributes to refentry tags in French man pages
    (apt-cdrom, apt-extracttemplates, apt-sortpkgs)
  * Change upgraded/newly installed/not fully installed or removed
    messages to be consistent and somewhat shorter (some translations
    exceeded 80 characters even in the simplest case)
  * Make APT::Get::Show-Upgraded (aka apt-get -u) default to true.
  * Updates to Dutch translation from Bart Cornelis <cobaco@linux.be>
    (Closes: #207656)

apt (0.5.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Oh well, apt isn't going to make it into testing anytime soon due to
    new glibc and gcc deps, so we might as well fix more bugs
  * Fix typo in example ftp-archive.conf (Closes: #203295)
  * Mention default setting for --all-versions (Closes: #203298)
  * Patch from Otavio Salvador <otavio@debian.org> to have --version
    only print the version (and not usage as well) (Closes: #203418)
  * Patch from Otavio Salvador <otavio@debian.org> to switch from
    dh_installmanpages to dh_installman.  Fixes the problem where the
    pt_BR man page was installed in the wrong location (Closes: #194558)
  * Move the French apt-ftparchive man page into apt-utils where it
    belongs.  apt-utils Replaces: apt (<< 0.5.9)
  * Write records from "apt-cache show" using fwrite(3) rather than
    write(2), in case for some reason the entire record doesn't get
    written by a single write(2)
  * Add new French man pages to doc/fr/.cvsignore
  * Add freebsd to buildlib/ostable (Closes: #193430)
  * Avoid segfault if a package name is specified which consists
    entirely of characters which look like end tags ('+', '-')
    (Closes: #200425)
  * Patch from Otavio Salvador <otavio@debian.org> to avoid listing
    suggests/recommends for packages which are selected for installation
    at the same time as the package which suggests/recommends them
    (Closes: #200102)
  * Patch from Otavio Salvador <otavio@debian.org> to avoid listing
    suggests/recommends which are Provided by a package which is already
    installed (Closes: #200395)
  * Patch to update pt_BR man page for apt_preferences(5) from Andre Luis
    Lopes <andrelop@debian.org> (Closes: #202245)
  * Use nl_langinfo(YESEXPR) rather than comparing to the translated
    string "Y".  Closes: #200953 and should make the prompting generally
    more robust in the face of i18n.  In the particular case of #200953,
    it was being fooled because of signedness issues with toupper(3)
    (Closes: #194614)
  * apt Suggests: aptitude | synaptic | gnome-apt | wajig
    (Closes: #146667)
  * Clean up whitespace in translated strings in ru.po, which messed up
    indentation (some other translations probably have similar problems)
    (Closes: #194282)
  * Run ispell -h over the man page sources and fix a bunch of typos
  * Use debian/compat rather than DH_COMPAT
  * Update to debhelper compatibility level 3
    - remove ldconfig calls from debian/{postinst,postrm} as dh_makeshlibs
      will add them
    - echo 3 > debian/compat
    - Build-Depends: debhelper (>= 3)
  * Exclude '.#*' from cvs-build
  * Let the ftp method work with ftp servers which do not require a
    password (Closes: #199425)
  * Build-depend on debhelper >= 4.1.62, because we need the fix for
    #204731 in order for dh_installman to work correctly
    with our SGML man pages
  * Move dh_makeshlibs ahead of dh_installdeb so that its postinst
    fragments are properly substituted

apt (0.5.8) unstable; urgency=medium

  * urgency=medium because the changes since 0.5.5.1 are pretty safe as
    far as core functionality, 0.5.5.1 survived unstable for 10 days, and
    I don't want to delay apt's progress into testing any further.  It's
    decidedly better than 0.5.4.
  * Clarify the meaning of the only-source option in apt-get(8)
    (Closes: #177258)
  * Updated French man pages from Philippe Batailler
    <philippe.batailler@free.fr> (Closes: #182194)
  * Give a warning if an illegal type abbreviation is used when looking up a
    configuration item (Closes: #168453)
  * Improve build-depends handling of virtual packages even further, so that
    it will now also try to satisfy build-depends on virtual packages if they
    are not installed.  Note that this only works if there is only one
    package providing the virtual package, as in other cases (Closes: #165404)
  * Update config.guess and config.sub from autotools-dev 20030717.1
  * Tweak SGML in apt-extracttemplates.1.sgml so that literal '>' doesn't end
    up in output
  * Document SrcDirectory in apt-ftparchive.1.sgml (Closes: #156370)
  * Support TMPDIR in apt-extracttemplates (Closes: #191656)
  * Fix ru.po to use a capital letter for the translation of 'Y' so that
    YnPrompt works correctly (Closes: #200953).  No other translations seem
    to have this problem
  * Regenerate POT file and sync .po files
  * Only try to clear stdin if it is a tty, to avoid looping if there is
    lots of stuff (perhaps an infinite amount) to read (Closes: #192228)

 -- Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org>  Fri, 25 Jul 2003 20:21:53 -0400

apt (0.5.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Skip version check if a build-dependency is provided by an installed package
    (Closes: #126938)
  * Have apt-cache show exit with an error if it cannot find any of the
    specified packages (Closes: #101490)

    - Remove duplicate 'showpkg' from synopsis on apt-cache(8)
      (Closes: #175611)
