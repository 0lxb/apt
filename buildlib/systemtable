# This file contains a table of known canonical system strings, with
# things to map them to. `configure' will take the output of the
# autoconf cannon macros and look in here. It will check for
# the full canonical system name (required for e.g. lpia) and if that 
# fails it will configure.in will fallback to just checking for the CPU
# in buildlib/archtable

# The left side is a regex for awk against the canonical system name

# config.guess reports lpia as i386-unknown-linux-gnulp
i.86-.*-linux-gnulp	lpia
