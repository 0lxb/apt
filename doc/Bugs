-- Real Problems
#24000: Bug in apt Version: 0.0.17-1bo0
 Summary: Couldn't locate an archive source for a package
 Status: Require Status file. 
#27601: srange errors from dselect
 Summary: Couldn't locate an archive source
 Status: Require status file
#26670: apt: apt-get dumps core after checking integrity
 Summary: Some terminal environments cause APT to crash
          Win95 telnet and emacs term-in-a-buffer are two at least
 Status: I have no idea why.
#23984: apt: support for "no_proxy" would be nice
 Status: Planed to be integrated into the new methods via the configuration
         file
#24685: HTTP Proxy cache refresh
 Summary: Some caches hold onto the package index file for too long
 Status: It may be possible to insert the proper header to disable
         caching but I can't think how to do this while allowing
	 the cache to return cached objects - in effect it would
	 completely disable the cache which may not be desired.
#24717: apt dies early if one postinst/preinst dies
 Status: Requires dpkg modifications
#25001: apt: cleaned out archive even though not all files were installed
 Status: Apparently in some cases APT can return a success code even 
         though it failed. I'm paying very close attention to this in
	 0.3.x. Not to mention that the clean behavior will be 
	 configurable..
#25021: apt: Need some control over multiple connections
 Status: Probable that 0.3.x will have support for configuing some
         parameters
#22892: Apt improvements
 Summary: Make use of redundant sources
 Status: 0.3.0 will likely do this, already the information for it is stored.
#24799: Some suggestions for the apt method in dselect
 Summary: Wants to be able to specifiy -d from dselect
 Status: Likely a APT_OPTIONS enviornment variable will be created, -d can
         be put there.
#25104: APT should retry failed downloads
 Summary: FTP method has problems with busy servers
 Status: The 0.3.0 ftp method should probably use the configuration mechanism
         to control this desired behavoir.
#25176: Problem with FTP/firewall
#25458: Problem with FTP/firewall
 Summary: FTP method has no controls for firewalls
 Status: The 0.3.0 ftp method should probably use the configuration mechanism
         to control this desired behavoir.

-- Fixed but unclosed things
#25026: apt: Why do you list the packages you're _not_ doing anything to instead of the ones you are?
#22507: apt: apt-get - listing packages to be upgraded (wishlist)
 Summary: Feature request 
 Status: Fixed in 0.3.0 via the -u option
#21113: [Apt] In dselect, update dies and exits if the packages file is not found.
 Status: Fixed in 0.3.0
#22675: APT does not honor the --admin-dir option
#22836: Disk/Zip-Method for apt?
 Summary: APT does not provide a way to download packages onto a 
          removable media for another computer
 Status: 0.3.0 has substantially better support for this to the point
         that it is doable by using a seperate configuration file and
	 the -c option

-- Silly things
#26592: apt: Problems with ftpd in SunOS 5.6
 Summary: SunOS ftpd does not support the SIZE command
 Status: Probably not worth fixing
#20723: Apt suggestion
 Summary: Package Grouping Mechanism
 Status: Who knows
#22550: apt-get upgrade could configure packages earlier
 Status: Who knows
#23934: apt-get source <package>
#27190: apt: installing source packages (wishlist)
 Status: Impossible to do without an index file for all source archives.
#26019: apt may report wrong line speed
#26433: apt: claims to fetch things it doesn't actually fetch (wishlist)
 Summary: APT includes the fetch time from the local cache in its
          calculations
 Status: Probably will be fixed with new acquire code
#26663: rsync file access
 Status: Unlikely, rsync does not provide the necessary support to be
         a terribly good method. I do not intend any 'split mode' 
	 support (ie a way to get Package files via rsync and .debs
	 via http) 
#22551: apt: wish: use dist X iff pkg does not exist in dist Y
#27100: apt: Better support for project/experimental
 Status: GUI Feature - Version selection and pinning
#25019: apt: Confusing progress report
 Summary: Gripes about the progress meter
 Status: I do not intend to implement very many of these ideas in apt-get. 
         The GUI will naturally be better
#25022: apt: Lack of feedback on date checking
 Summary: Wants to know what package files were not updated
 Status: There is no place for this in the current apt-get design,
         probably won't make the GUI either.
